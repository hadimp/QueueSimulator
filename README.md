# QueueSimulator
A Java code for simulating a bank and a grocery store with multiple queues and tellers/cashiers where semaphores and locks are utilized for synchronization. In both cases, customers arrive, join queues, get served by tellers/cashiers, and statistics -including the total number of customers arrived, turned away, and the average service time- are recorded. The simulation progresses in discrete time steps with each step triggerring queue updates, customer arrivals, and service.
